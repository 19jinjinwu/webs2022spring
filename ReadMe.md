# Description
This website project is designed for a (fictional) cat cafe called Whipped Whiskers. Here, you are able to order a cup of coffee for an afternoon lunch, play with cats in the cat room, and possible adopt a cat! Whipped Whiskers is a cat sanctuary for cats that were brought in from the streets, cat shelters, or had no other place to go. The website was designed in order to not only introduce visitors to the cafe, but also learn more about the cats that have arrived at their temporary home. I hope to create a comfortable and cozy environment through the website's style, so that viewers will be enticed to visit, and give a cat their forever home.

# Proposal

I plan to create a website portfolio for future employers, showcasing my artistic and design work.

At the top I have my socials and contact, including a link to my resume and LinkedIn, and a contact form that will pop up on the screen. Then there will be a section for my name and interests, followed by a section for my biography (education and previous occupation). Lastly, I will have a section that links to the _inner pages of my portfolio_, with clickable boxes that showcases my unity projects, game art, digital art, website design, graphic design, and traditional art.

# Updated Proposal

Since I already have a portfolio of my own, I thought it would be more interesting to create a cat cafe website. It has a similar setup to my portfolio, with a navbar for the pages at the top, a hero image with a title, and clickable boxes at the bottom featuring the cats that are adoptable. The only difference is that there will be a reservation form instead of the about section, and possibly inner pages to the menu, cats, about, and contact depending on time.
