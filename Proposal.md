# Proposal

I plan to create a website portfolio for future employers, showcasing my artistic and design work.

At the top I have my socials and contact, including a link to my resume and LinkedIn, and a contact form that will pop up on the screen. Then there will be a section for my name and interests, followed by a section for my biography (education and previous occupation). Lastly, I will have a section that links to the _inner pages of my portfolio_, with clickable boxes that showcases my unity projects, game art, digital art, website design, graphic design, and traditional art.
