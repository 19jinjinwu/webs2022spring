# Reflection
Baseline criteria met:
* Used arrangement with side-by-side photos vs. negative space, color with recurring black/white/beige, contrast between dark and light.
* Navigable html location to cats.html, index.html, locations for specific cats and reservation form.
* Clear mode of navigation with navbar at top/fixed and header icon linking back to home page.
* Sitewide css stylesheet between index.html and cats.html., made meaningful commit messages.
* Important images have alt texts, with credited assets in README.md. 
* Successfully displayed at https://19jinjinwu.github.io/webs2022spring/

Aspirational criteria:
* Playable media (video) as background for index.html. Images laid out in clear pattern—grid in index.html and flex in cats.html.
* Used responsive design (@media queries, vw, etc.), animated buttons and links (:hover), added interactivity via Javascript (contact form pops up on-click), included forms (reservation, contact) with user input.
* Used flexbox/grid layouts, advanced navigation with a fixed navbar in cats.html, condensed css (to an extent), used jQuery for contact form, added comments to code for clarity.
* Fonts are cohesive, compatible with mobile devices.

According to my feedback, my website was organized with a clear intent. They mentioned that my navigation links (at the header) were not working, and that the reservation form was slightly confusing because there was no confirmation that the input was submitted. Likewise, they also suggested to have the time input to be a unified color and limited to selective options, and also adding more information to the head--that is, with a favicon. At the time of the evalution, I was only working on the homepage, but I have since added the contact pop-up form and cats page. I took both their feedback into consideration and I added a favicon (which lead me to revert the color of my logo and change the CSS for the html pages). For the form, I changed the input class to a select class so that the options would be selective, added a "display:none;" option for a blank initial value, and changed the font for the input because the original did not have an "@" symbol.

## Summary
Overall, I met the baseline criteria and was able to hit some parts of the aspirational criteria. Even though I took an intro to website design course before, there were many things I learned through this unit, including the Javascript, JQuery, grid layout, time input, interactive button effects, using playable media as a “hero image,” and modal popup when submitting a form. I was pretty familiar with the html setup, padding, and responsive design, but to implement code (besides CSS) was challenging. I wanted my website to look cohesive and professional, which required the elements to be simple, clear, and concise with clear borders. The video in the landing screen is necessary to immediately grab the viewer’s attention, with the cat staring directly at them. The buttons make it easier for viewers to immediately reserve a spot (if they are solely visiting or have been here before), and the featured cats are for those who are simply interested in adopting a cat. The fonts are rounded so that they have a more friendly and inviting feel, with a cursive font for the title—to sort of emulate a cozy café that serves drink with whipped cream. For the landing screen, I wanted a lot of the overlapping elements to be transparent so that it does not take away from the cat-themed website (ex: contact form and reservation forms). If I had more time, I would create a menu page for the drinks that the café serves, make the forms more mobile friendly, and design a more inviting theme for the cats.html page. Right now, the cat “cards” are a little to angular to me, and the color scheme seems a bit too serious (lots of blacks) compared to the home page.
