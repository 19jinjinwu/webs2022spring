For my preview, I started building out the basic layout of the cat cafe. For the first section at the top, I placed a hero image in the HTML doc and made the navbar, icon, h1, and text absolute positioned so that they would fit over the image. I used a flexbox for the header and the text dividers of the section, and made the margins/paddings responsive by setting their values based off percentages and vw/vh. I chose to go for a white-color text, and plan on adding a black border so that it would have contrast against the hero image; I'll also need to invert the color fo the logo to make it match the text. The hero image is a gif, and I set the width based on the vw so that it would be responsive. I removed the bullet points from the navbar list, and I plan on making the text white, removing the underline, and creating padding between the different links. The second section of the website is a reservation form, which is split using a flexbox; I plan on making the left side have a transparent black overlay. I created a simple form but I will make it more spaced out between the boxes, and visually appealing with rounded borders, transparent boxes, and a wider submit button. The last section is for the featured cats up for adoption. I plan to make the "and more" link an actual button. The card "cards" were created using flexboxes, and I want to make them more responsive--possibly with flex wrap or @media. I plan on adding a black background behind the text, and then changing the text color to white. Besides the changes I've stated, I also need to find a legible font for the text, and a more stylized, cursive font for the title. I also need to add a footer and more html pages so that the navbar can actually navigate somewhere.
